# V3_V4_regions
Scripts for surveillance of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene
By Rodrigo García López for Adrián Ochoa's lab at IBT, UNAM
This set of scripts was created for the analyses of the V3 and V4 hypervariable region but most are general purpose ecological comparisons. They include solutions for dimensional reductions, sparcity reduction, etc, as well as Hill number calculations, alpha, etc.
